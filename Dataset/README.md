Due to volume of datasets, I upload the source of the dataset [here](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).
Secondary data found using the `tidyquant` package API which pulls from Yahoo Finance. 
Secondary Data collection starts from January 20, 2020 to match the COVID-19 data, and is maintained for investors and traders to keep track of financial changes.
